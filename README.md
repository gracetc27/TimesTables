# TimesTables 
Challenge 3 in my 100 days of SwiftUI- Hacking with Swift journey. This app really consolidates skills learnt in the previous projects in this course.
This is the third app built with no tutorials. It is a simple app to practice times table, allowing the user to select a number limit and how many questions they want to be asked.
